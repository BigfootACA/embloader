Description: Make systemd-boot use embloader
 This package diverts the systemd-boot EFI binaries to use embloader instead.
 It provides drop-in compatibility with systemd-boot while using embloader's
 enhanced features like device tree overlay support and SMBIOS-based device
 detection.
 .
 The original systemd-boot binaries are preserved with .distrib suffix and
 can be restored by removing this package.
